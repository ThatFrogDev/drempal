Dodge the Knifes! A fun little game where you play as a ninja, dodging the knifes and getting coins. The game is really dodgy. Please, for your own sanity, never try using GDevelop's JavaScript Engine. I had more stress from it than any other game engine that just works with coding. Exporting didn't work. I coded a score system but i couldn't get it exported.

The name is thought of by my friend Dimkauzh who I was planning on making this game with.
